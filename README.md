# WebSocket RPC
Simple implementation of an RPC system over the WebSocket technology.

In the future I'll write some more lines to describe my work and I'll hopefully improve and extend what I made.

Here you can find 3 files:
  - index.html
  - test.py 
  - WebSocket.py
  
The last one is the main core class: it provides clients, websockets and packets handling.
The second one is a simple script to show what the core class can do with just two lines of code.
The first one is a dumb client page to connect to the websocket server.

The code was designed to run on python 3.

To run the server enter:
./python3 test.py

I hope you'll find it interesting :)
